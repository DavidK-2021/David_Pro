   <p><b>Appearance.</b>Super Sonic appears the same as he does
   in "Sonic the Comic" He has the same appearence as Classic
   Super Sonic, with yellow fur and spiked up hair. The only notable difference
   is the eyes, which appear as red and white spirals instead of
   the usual green irises, and the toothy grin, which usually isn't so jagged.Unlike Super Sonic in the mainstream Sonic
    Franchise, who maintains his heroic and cheerful attitude when he's not empowered,
    Super is the complete opposite, as he is dark, reckless and blood hungry.
    He is also very sadistic,<span class="text"> as when he thought he killed Sonic's friends, he lets out a horrifying bowl of laughter.
    After suffering from amnesia, Super acts just as kind and nice as his non-super counterpart.
    Even when he regains his memories, he refuses to use his powers out of fear that he'll return to being the heartless monster he once was.
     </span></p>



  <p><b>Trivia</b>Many of his death quotes refer to Sonic.exe mockingly.
    For instance: "If little blue hedgehogs covered in blood scare you, you ain't ready to fight me."
    Furthermore, Sonic saying "NOW I’LL SHOW YOU!" might be a reference to Super Smash Bros.
    Brawl, in which his Final Smash, he turns into Super Sonic and says "NOW I'LL SHOW YOU!" and grunts.

  However, his inclusion may perhaps be a subtle nod to the fanmade comic "Save Sonic" by Gigi-D, which ends with the original Sonic (inside his mind)
  trying make peace with his evil self,
  only for Fleetway Super Sonic to erase him completely and taking over his body,
  turning him into Sonic.Exe.
